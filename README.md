Goals • to implement graph and tree data structures, and to understand the performance oftheir traversalsRequirementsand Notes • Develop several of your own implementations of an undirected graph.The @ile graphs1.txt contains data describing multiple undirectedgraphs. Read it and create three versions of each graph:1. as a matrix2. as an adjacency list3. as linked objectsFor each graph, print the matrix and adjacency list versions. For thelinked objects version of each graph, perform <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="12767762667a3f527b606166">[email protected]</a> and breadth-@irst traversals, printing each vertex’s IDs as you encounter it. (I.e., printall of the vertex IDs in “<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="46222336322e6b062f343532">[email protected]</a>” order and then in “<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="482a3a2d292c3c206508213a3b3c">[email protected]</a>”order.)• Develop your own implementation of a binary search tree. Using thetext @ile magicitems.txt from our web site, populate your BST withthat data.• Randomly select 42 magic items and look up each in the BST. Print thenumber of comparisons for each lookup and compute the overallaverage.• In your LaTeX summary and analysis document, analyze the asymptoticrunning time of both graph traversals and explain why it is that way.Also analyze the asymptotic running time of BST lookups and explainthat as well.[60 points][30 points][10 points]Of course, your code must …• separate structure from presentation.• be professionally formatted yet uniquely yours (show some personality)• use and demonstrate best practices.• make me proud to be your teacher.[−∞ if not]Resources • Graphs are described in our text in section 22.1 on via notes linked from our web page.• <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="9ad8e8fffbfeeef2b7daf3e8e9ee">[email protected]</a> and <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="27434257534f0a674e555453">[email protected]</a> traversals are described in our text in sections 22.2 and22.3 respectively.• Trees are described in our text in chapters 12, 13, and 18.Submi5ngYour Work In addition to your source code, commit your LaTeX document in both .tex and .pdf formsto your GitHub repository. For your code, make many commits to GitHub. If you don’t makeenough commits, I will not accept your work. Be sure that you make your @inal commit forthis assignment on or before the due date. (See our syllabus for those details.)Assignment 4 – 100 points
